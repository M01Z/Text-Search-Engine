The man finished his basin and called for another the rum being signalled for in yet
stronger proportion. The effect of it was soon apparent in his manner and his wife but
too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquortent
she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers.
The child began to prattle impatiently and the wife more than once said to her
husband Michael how about our lodging? You know we may have trouble in getting
it if we don’t go soon.
But he turned a deaf ear to those birdlike chirpings. He talked loud to the company.
The child’s black eyes after slow round ruminating gazes at the candles when they
were lighted fell together then they opened then shut again and she slept.
At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity at the second he was jovial at
the third argumentative at the fourth the qualities signified by the shape of his face
the occasional clench of his mouth and the fiery spark of his dark eye began to tell in
his conduct he was overbearing even brilliantly quarrelsome.
The conversation took a high turn as it often does on such occasions. The ruin of good
men by bad wives and more particularly the frustration of many a promising youths
high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent
marriage was the theme.
