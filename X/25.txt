THE MORNING sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas when the man
awoke. A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee and a single big
blue fly buzzed musically round and round it. Besides the buzz of the fly there was not
a sound. He looked about at the benches at the table supported by trestles at his
basket of tools at the stove where the furmity had been boiled at the empty basins at
some shed grains of wheat at the corks which dotted the grassy floor. Among the odds
and ends he discerned a little shining object and picked it up. It was his wifes ring.
A confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed to come back to him
and he thrust his hand into his breastpocket. A rustling revealed the sailors banknotes
thrust carelessly in.
