From this tower the clock struck eight and thereupon a bell began to toll with a
peremptory clang. The curfew was still rung in Casterbridge and it was utilized by the
inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops. No sooner did the deep notes of the bell
throb between the house-fronts than a clatter of shutters arose through the whole length
of the High Street. In a few minutes business at Casterbridge was ended for the day.
Other clocks struck eight from time to time- one gloomily from the gaol another from
the gable of an almshouse with a preparative creak of machinery more audible than
the note of the bell a row of tall varnished case-clocks from the interior of a
clockmakers shop joined in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them
like a row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the curtain then
chimes were heard stammering out the Sicilian Mariners Hymn so that chronologists
of the advanced school were appreciably on their way to the next hour before the whole
business of the old one was satisfactorily wound up.
In an open space before the church walked a woman with her gown-sleeves rolled up
so high that the edge of her under-linen was visible and her skirt tucked up through
her pocket hole. She carried a loaf under her arm from which she was pulling pieces of
bread and handing them to some other women who walked with her which pieces
they nibbled critically. The sight reminded Mrs. HenchardNewson and her daughter
that they had an appetite and they inquired of the woman for the nearest bakers.
Ye may as well look for manna-food as good bread in Casterbridge just now she
said after directing them. They can blare their trumpets and thump their drums and
have their roaring dinners- waving her hand towards a point further along the street
