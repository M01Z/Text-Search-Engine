The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying Now
this is the last lot now wholl take the last lot for a song Shall I say forty shillings Tis

the hoss at all except that shes a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked
out by the kick of another her own sister coming along the road. For my part I dont

em up and sell em by auction to men who are in want of such articles Hey Why

do that some of the guests replied looking at the woman who was by no means illfavoured.
