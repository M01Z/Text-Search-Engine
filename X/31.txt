agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment which was done. Then he
started on the search for his wife and child.
The perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough.
Though he examined and inquired and walked hither and thither day after day no
such characters as those he described had anywhere been seen since the evening of the
fair. To add to the difficulty he could gain no sound of the sailors name.
As money was short with him he decided after some hesitation to spend the sailors
money in the prosecution of this search but it was equally in vain. The truth was that a
certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from following
up the investigation with the loud hueandcry such a pursuit demanded to render it
effectual and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue though
everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances
under which he had lost her.
Weeks counted up to months and still he searched on maintaining himself by small
jobs of work in the intervals. By this time he had arrived at a seaport and there he
derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated
a little time before. Then he said he would search no longer and that he would go and
settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind. Next day he started
journeying southwestward and did not pause except for nights lodgings till he
reached the town of Casterbridge in a far distant part of Wessex
