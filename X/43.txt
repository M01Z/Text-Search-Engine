At any rate the propriety of returning to him if he lived was unquestionable.
The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth a proceeding
which her mother could not endure to contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake
the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard leaving it
to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end. This will
account for their conversation at the fair and the half-informed state in which Elizabeth
was led onward.
In this attitude they proceeded on their journey trusting solely to the dim light
afforded of Henchards whereabouts by the furmity woman. The strictest economy was
indispensable. Sometimes they might have been seen on foot sometimes on farmers
waggons sometimes in carriers vans; and thus they drew near to Casterbridge.
Elizabeth-Jane discovered to her alarm that her mothers health was not what it once
had been and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory tone which
showed that but for the girl she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was growing
thoroughly weary of.
