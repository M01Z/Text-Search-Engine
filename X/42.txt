The sight of the girl made her mother sad not vaguely but by logical inference. They
both were still in that straitwaistcoat of poverty from which she had tried so many
times to be delivered for the girls sake. The woman had long perceived how zealously
and constantly the young mind of her companion was struggling for enlargement; and
yet now in her eighteenth year it still remained but little unfolded. The desire sober
and repressed of ElizabethJanes heart was indeed to see to hear and to understand.
How could she become a woman of wider knowledge higher repute better as she
termed it this was her constant inquiry of her mother. She sought further into things
than other girls in her position ever did and her mother groaned as she felt she could
not aid in the search.
The sailor was now lost to them; and Susans staunch religious adherence to him as her
husband in principle till her views had been disturbed by enlightenment was
demanded no more. She asked herself whether the present moment now that she was a
free woman again were not as opportune a one as she would find in a world where
everything had been so inopportune for making a desperate effort to advance
Elizabeth. To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed wisely or not
the best initiatory step. He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might on
the other hand have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been
given to bouts only and was not a habitual drunkard.
