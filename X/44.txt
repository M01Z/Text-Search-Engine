It was on a Friday evening near the middle of September and just before dusk that
they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of the place they sought. There were
highbanked hedges to the coachroad here and they mounted upon the green turf
within and sat down. The spot commanded a full view of the town and its environs.
What an oldfashioned place it seems to be! said ElizabethJane while her silent
mother mused on other things than topography. It is huddled all together; and it is
shut in by a square wall of trees like a plot of garden ground by a boxedging. Its
squareness was indeed the characteristic which most struck the eye in this antiquated
borough the borough of Casterbridge at that time recent as it was untouched by the
faintest sprinkle of modernism. It was compact as a box of dominoes. It had no
suburbs in the ordinary sense. Country and town met at a mathematical line.
To birds of the more soaring kind Casterbridge must have appeared on this fine
evening as a mosaicwork of subdued reds browns greys and crystals held together
by a rectangular frame of deep green. To the level eye of humanity it stood as an
indistinct mass behind a dense stockade of limes and chestnuts set in the midst of
miles of rotund down and concave field. The mass became gradually dissected by the
vision into towers gables chimneys and casements the highest glazings shining
bleared and bloodshot with the coppery fire they caught from the belt of sunlit cloud in
the west.
