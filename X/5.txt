For a long time there was none beyond the voice of a weak bird singing a trite old
evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the hill at the same hour and
with the selfsame trills quavers and breves at any sunset of that season for centuries
untold. But as they approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles reached
their ears from some elevated spot in that direction as yet screened from view by
foliage. When the outlying houses of WeydonPriors could just be descried the family
group was met by a turniphoer with his hoe on his shoulder and his dinnerbag
suspended from it. The reader promptly glanced up.
Any trade doing here? he asked phlegmatically designating the village in his van by
a wave of the broadsheet. And thinking the labourer did not understand him he
added Anything in the haytrussing line? The turniphoer had already begun
shaking his head. Why save the man what wisdoms in him that a should come to
Weydon for a job of that sort this time o year? Then is there any house to let a little
small new cottage just a builded or such like? asked the other.
