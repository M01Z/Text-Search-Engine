o of late summer before the present century had reached its thirtieth
year a young man and woman the latter carrying a child were approaching the large
village of WeydonPriors in Upper Wessex on foot. They were plainly but not ill clad
though the thick hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments
from an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their appearance
just now.
The man was of fine figure swarthy and stern in aspect and he showed in profile a
facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular. He wore a short jacket of
brown corduroy newer than the remainder of his suit which was a fustian waistcoat
with white horn buttons breeches of the same tanned leggings and a straw hat
overlaid with black glazed canvas. At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush
basket from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hayknife a wimble for haybonds
being also visible in the aperture. His measured springless walk was the walk of
the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer
while in the turn and plant of each foot there was further a dogged and cynical
indifference personal to himself showing its presence even in the regularly
interchanging fustian folds now in the left leg now in the right as he paced along.
