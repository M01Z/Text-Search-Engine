Time and Chance except perhaps fair play. The first phase was the work of Nature
the second probably of civilization.
That the man and woman were husband and wife and the parents of the girl in arms
there could be little doubt. No other than such relationship would have accounted for
the atmosphere of stale familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus
as they moved down the road.
The wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead though with little interest the scene for that
matter being one that might have been matched at almost any spot in any county in
England at this time of the year; a road neither straight nor crooked neither level nor
hilly bordered by hedges trees and other vegetation which had entered the
blackenedgreen stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on their way to
dingy and yellow and red. The grassy margin of the bank and the nearest hedgerow
boughs were powdered by the dust that had been stirred over them by hasty vehicles
the same dust as it lay on the road deadening their footfalls like a carpet; and this with
the aforesaid total absence of conversation allowed every extraneous sound to be
heard.
