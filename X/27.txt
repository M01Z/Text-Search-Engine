Here the man looked around with gloomy curiosity. The freshness of the September
morning inspired and braced him as he stood. He and his family had been weary when
they arrived the night before and they had observed but little of the place so that he
now beheld it as a new thing. It exhibited itself as the top of an open down bounded
on one extreme by a plantation and approached by a winding road. At the bottom
stood the village which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair that was held
thereon. The spot stretched downward into valleys and onward to other uplands
dotted with barrows and trenched with the remains of prehistoric forts. The whole
scene lay under the rays of a newly risen sun which had not as yet dried a single blade
of the heavily dewed grass whereon the shadows of the yellow and red vans were
projected far away those thrown by the felloe of each wheel being elongated in shape
to the orbit of a comet. All the gipsies and showmen who had remained on the ground
lay snug within their carts and tents or wrapped in horsecloths under them and were
silent and still as death with the exception of an occasional snore that revealed their
presence. But the Seven Sleepers had a dog and dogs of the mysterious breeds that
vagrants own that are as much like cats as dogs and as much like foxes as cats also lay
about here. A little one started up under one of the carts barked as a matter of
principle and quickly lay down again. He was the only positive spectator of the haytrussers
exit from the Weydon Fairfield.
