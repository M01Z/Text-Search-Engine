ascended to the fair. Here too it was evident that the years had told. Certain
mechanical improvements might have been noticed in the roundabouts and highfliers
machines for testing rustic strength and weight and in the erections devoted to
shooting for nuts. But the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled. The new
periodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to interfere seriously
with the trade carried on here for centuries. The pens for sheep the tie-ropes for horses
were about half as long as they had been. The stalls of tailors hosiers coopers linendrapers
and other such trades had almost disappeared and the vehicles were far less
numerous. The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little distance and
then stood still.
