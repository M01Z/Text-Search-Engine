What was really peculiar however in this couples progress and would have attracted
the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed to overlook them was the
perfect silence they preserved. They walked side by side in such a way as to suggest
afar off the low easy confidential chat of people full of reciprocity but on closer view
it could be discerned that the man was reading or pretending to read a ballad sheet
which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the hand that was passed
through the basket strap. Whether this apparent cause were the real cause or whether
it were an assumed one to escape an intercourse that would have been irksome to him
nobody but himself could have said precisely but his taciturnity was unbroken and
the woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence. Virtually she walked the
highway alone save for the child she bore. Sometimes the mans bent elbow almost
touched her shoulder for she kept as close to his side as was possible without actual
contact but she seemed to have no idea of taking his arm nor he of offering it and far
from exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it as a natural
thing. If any word at all were uttered by the little group it was an occasional whisper
of the woman to the child- a tiny girl in short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarnand
the murmured babble of the child in reply
