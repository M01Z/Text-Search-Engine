For seafaring naters be very good shelter for shorn lambs and the man do seem to
have plenty of money which is what shes not been used to lately by all showings.
Mark me Ill not go after her! said the trusser returning doggedly to his seat. Let
her go! If shes up to such vagaries she must suffer for em. Shed no business to take
the maid tis my maid; and if it were the doing again she shouldnt have her! Perhaps
from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible proceeding perhaps
because it was late the customers thinned away from the tent shortly after this episode.
The man stretched his elbows forward on the table leant his face upon his arms and
soon began to snore. The furmity seller decided to close for the night and after seeing
the rumbottles milk corn raisins &c. that remained on hand loaded into the cart
came to where the man reclined. She shook him but could not wake him. As the tent
was not to be struck that night the fair continuing for two or three days she decided to
let the sleeper who was obviously no tramp stay where he was and his basket with
him. Extinguishing the last candle and lowering the flap of the tent she left it and
drove away.
