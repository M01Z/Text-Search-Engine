Yes my dear ElizabethJane explained the other. But I had a fancy for looking up

 Why It was here I first met with Newson on such a day as this. First met with
father here Yes you have told me so before. And now hes drowned and gone from

was edged with black and inscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were
the words In affectionate memory of Richard Newson mariner who wasunfortunately lost at sea in the month of November 184_ aged fortyone years. And
it was here continued her mother with more hesitation that I last saw the relation
we are going to look for Mr. Michael Henchard. What is his exact kin to us mother
I have never clearly had it told me. He is or was for he may be dead a connection
by marriage said her mother deliberately.
