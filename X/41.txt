Of Henchard they heard nothing. To the liege subjects of Labour the England of those
days was a continent and a mile of geographical degree.
ElizabethJane developed early into womanliness. One day a month or so after
receiving intelligence of Newsons death off the Bank of Newfoundland when the girl
was about eighteen she was sitting on a willow chair in the cottage they still occupied
working twine nets for the fishermen. Her mother was in a back corner of the same
room engaged in the same labour and dropping the heavy wood noodle she was
filling she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully. The sun shone in at the door upon the
young womans head and hair which was worn loose so that the rays streamed into its
depths as into a hazel copse. Her face though somewhat wan and incomplete
possessed the raw materials of beauty in a promising degree. There was an underhandsomeness
in it struggling to reveal itself through the provisional curves of
immaturity and the casual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened
circumstances of their lives. She was handsome in the bone hardly as yet handsome in
the flesh. She possibly might never be fully handsome unless the carking accidents of
her daily existence could be evaded before the mobile parts of her countenance had
settled to their final mould.
