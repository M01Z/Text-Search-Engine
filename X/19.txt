The sight of real money in full amount in answer to a challenge for the same till then
deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon the spectators.
Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief actors and then upon the notes as
they lay weighted by the shillings on the table.
Up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the man in spite of
his tantalizing declaration was really in earnest. The spectators had indeed taken the
proceedings throughout as a piece of mirthful irony carried to extremes; and had
assumed that being out of work he was as a consequence out of temper with the
world and society and his nearest kin. But with the demand and response of real cash
the jovial frivolity of the scene departed. A lurid colour seemed to fill the tent and
change the aspect of all therein. The mirthwrinkles left the listeners faces and they
waited with parting lips.
Now said the woman breaking the silence so that her low dry voice sounded quite
loud before you go further Michael listen to me. If you touch that money I and this
girl go with the man. Mind it is a joke no longer.
